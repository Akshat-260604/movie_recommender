The dataset is of movies that is taken from Kaggle. The data is pre-processed and then vectorization is used on the tags to give a matrix to each movie and when we input the name of the movie it recommends the name of other movies on the basis of matrix matching (or by the process of vectorization). We have used vectorization instead of models here because of dataset. The dataset consists of continuous values which is useful for vectorization.
